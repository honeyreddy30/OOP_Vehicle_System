Vehicle System â€“ OOP Project
Description
This project is a simple vehicle system that shows how object-oriented programming (OOP) works. It includes different types of vehicles like cars, motorcycles, and trucks. Each vehicle has its own way of calculating fuel efficiency. Trucks also follow maintenance rules using an interface. The repair shop can service vehicles and estimate repair costs.
